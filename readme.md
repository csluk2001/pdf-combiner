# pdf-combiner

## scenario
I am a Windows user, and sometimes when I want to combine some confidential PDFs, I don't want to use those pieces of software from Adobe or Foxit. Therefore, I made a simple one for myself.

I am not familiar with Python, therefore, I was thinking of some small project ideas in order to get more familiar with Python. I came out with the above scenario.

Library used: ```pyqt, pypdf```

Software: ```\dist\pdf-combiner.exe```
```***Create a shortcut of the executable file so that it can use the pdf-icon in the display```
